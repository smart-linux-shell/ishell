# Integration of Session Recording and Documentation System for ishell



## Problem Statement

When working with Linux systems, users often face complex tasks that require consulting documentation or experts. The ishell project provides an AI agent to assist in such situations, however several problems emerge:

1. Lack of connection between AI recommendations and user's actual actions:
   - Unable to track which agent recommendations proved useful
   - No information about how users adapted the proposed solutions
   - Problem-solving context is lost after session ends
   - Cannot validate effectiveness of AI suggestions

2. Difficulty in reusing found solutions:
   - Current bookmarking system only saves dialogs with agent, without related terminal commands
   - No way to preserve complete problem-solving scenarios
   - Missing mechanism for documenting successful solutions
   - Hard to share knowledge between team members

3. Organizational knowledge gaps:
   - Each user solves similar problems from scratch
   - No ability to analyze common problems and their solutions
   - Difficult to create documentation based on real usage experience
   - Lost opportunity to improve AI agent based on successful interactions

## Project Goal

Create a system that tracks and documents connections between AI agent dialogs and actual user terminal commands in ishell, with the ability to generate structured session protocols that can be used for knowledge sharing and documentation.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Tracking System (mandatory)
- Record temporal sequence of agent interactions
- Log executed commands in dialog context
- Save command execution results (status, output)
- Link commands to specific agent recommendations
- Track session duration and command timing

### 2. Enhanced Bookmarking System (mandatory)
- Add related terminal commands to saved dialogs
- Ability to mark successful problem-solving scenarios
- Add tags and metadata to scenarios
- Support scenario export/import
- Group related scenarios by topic/problem type

### 3. Protocol Generation (optional)
- Create markdown documents upon session completion
- Structured representation of dialogs and commands
- Include metadata (time, tags, execution status)
- Selective logging based on tags/topics
- Support for multiple protocol formats

### 4. User Interface (optional)
- Integration with system mode for logging control
- Current protocol preview capability
- Filtering and search in saved protocols
- Simple way to mark successful solutions

### 5. Protocol Requirements (optional)
- Standard markdown formatting
- Clear structure: problem → dialog → commands → result
- Support for automatic scenario aggregation
- Option to include terminal screenshots
- Proper code block formatting with syntax highlighting

### 6. Additional Features (optional)
- Support for subsequent protocol analysis using LLM for:
  * Consolidation of similar scenarios
  * Identification of common problems and solutions
  * Generation of topic summaries
  * Documentation creation based on protocols
  * Improvement suggestions for the AI agent

## Expected Deliverables

1. Source code:
   - Protocol recording system implementation
   - Enhanced bookmarking system
   - Protocol generation module
   - UI extensions for ishell

2. Documentation:
   - System architecture description
   - API documentation
   - User guide
   - Installation and configuration instructions

3. Example Artifacts:
   - Set of generated protocols in markdown format
   - Sample consolidated knowledge base
   - Example documentation generated from protocols
## Success Criteria

1. The system successfully captures and links AI dialogs with terminal commands
2. Users can generate readable and useful session protocols
3. Protocols can be effectively used for knowledge sharing
4. The system integrates smoothly with existing ishell functionality
5. Performance impact is minimal and acceptable
