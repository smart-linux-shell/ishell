# Investigation of TUI/TUX for Linux

Several libraries were evaluated to find the most suitable framework for developing TUX, focusing on lightweight architecture and design, minimal dependencies.

## Evaluation of TUI/TUX frameworks and libraries

### Evaluation criteria

* **Lightweight** - minimal footprint, suitable for all devices and various hardware using Linux OS
* **Support for adding frame layouts** - similar to _tmux_ or _tile managers_, the library should allow flexible frame layouts
* **Minimal dependencies** - for easier installation and fewer compatibility issues

### Considered libraries

After deep research of the projects and libraries from the [list](https://github.com/rothgar/awesome-tuis), these libraries were considered for further investigation, because of their **lightweight**, **flexibility** and **minimal dependencies**:

Also, it has an active community and extensive documentation.

## Prototype

![demo_tui-tux](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18bd7d8c-102a-49bd-8f96-2584c15a95fc)

### Features

* **Multi-frame layout** - support for multiple frames (one for dialog/assistant, others for bash) within the same terminal window.
* **Frame switching** - switching between different frames using _Ctrl+Tab_ and _Ctrl+Shift+Tab_, adding new frames using _Ctrl+T_ and _Ctrl+X_ to remove frame in focus.
* **Command execution** - executing commands in bash frame and displaying results.
* **Theming** - support for customizable themes and focus management.
* **Session** - all commands within one frame are saved during the session.
